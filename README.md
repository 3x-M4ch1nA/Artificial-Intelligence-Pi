# Artifical Intelligence Pi
### Turn your Raspberry Pi into your own personal assistant using the Amazon Echo Alexa voice service!

This repository accompanies my tutorial. This is a complete guide on setting up Alexa for your Raspberry Pi and can be found here: <in development>

##Information
You will need:
* A Raspberry Pi connected to the internet (my tutorial uses the Raspberry Pi 3, but it should work with every model)
* An SD Card with a fresh install of Raspbian (tested with 2016-05 Raspbian)
* An External Speaker with 3.5mm Jack (like this one: https://www.amazon.co.uk/XMI-Generation-Capsule-Compatible-Smartphones/dp/B001UEBN42/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1464643924&sr=8-3&keywords=mini+speaker)
* A USB Microphone (ideally make sure it is a plug n play one! I used this expensive one: https://www.amazon.co.uk/SAMSON-METEOR-Samson-Meteor-USB-Microphone/dp/B004MF39YS/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1464643977&sr=8-1&keywords=samson+meteor but a cheaper one such as this *should* work: https://www.amazon.co.uk/Tonor-Professional-Condenser-Microphone-Computer/dp/B01142EPO4/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1464644011&sr=8-3&keywords=usb+microphone)
* A Raspberry Pi Official SenseHAT add-on (https://thepihut.com/products/raspberry-pi-sense-hat-astro-pi)

### Thank You!

The work in this repository is based off of the work of Novaspirit and Sammachin. I would also like to thank my good friend Simon Beal (muddyfish) for his help in getting this up and going!
